# SEMS Frontend Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the frontend implementation for the Smart Expense Management System (SEMS). The backend services are well implemented with comprehensive API endpoints, particularly for the expense approval workflow.

## Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Framework**: React or Angular for component-based UI development
- **State Management**: Redux (for React) or NgRx (for Angular)
- **API Communication**: Axios or Fetch for HTTP requests
- **UI Component Library**: Material UI, Ant Design, or Bootstrap
- **Form Handling**: Formik or React Hook Form (for React)
- **Validation**: Yup or Joi
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with secure token storage
- **Charting/Visualizations**: Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress

## Key Frontend Components

### Core Components
1. **Authentication Module**
   - Login/Signup screens
   - Password reset
   - Session management

2. **Dashboard**
   - Summary metrics (total expenses, pending approvals, etc.)
   - Recent activity
   - Expense trends visualization
   - Budget utilization charts

3. **Expense Management**
   - Expense list with filtering and search
   - Expense creation form with receipt upload
   - Expense details view
   - Edit/delete expense functionality

4. **Approval Workflow**
   - Approval inbox for managers/approvers
   - Multi-level approval visualization
   - Approval actions (approve, reject, request changes)
   - Expense history/audit trail view

5. **Budget Management**
   - Budget creation and configuration
   - Budget tracking dashboards
   - Department and project budget allocation
   - Budget vs. actual comparisons

6. **Reporting**
   - Custom report generation
   - Export functionality (PDF, Excel)
   - Scheduled reports configuration

### Additional Features
- **Notifications System**: For approval requests, status changes
- **User Profile Management**: Personal information, preferences
- **Admin Panel**: User management, system configuration
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: For expense submission on-the-go

## API Integration Points

### User Service
- Authentication endpoints
- User profile management
- Role and permission management

### Expense Service
- CRUD operations for expenses
- Expense search and filtering
- Attachment handling for receipts

### Expense Approval Workflow
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/submit`: Submit expense for approval
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/approve`: Approve expense
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/reject`: Reject expense
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/request-changes`: Request changes
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/escalate`: Escalate to higher level
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/delegate`: Delegate approval
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/{expenseId}/history`: Get approval history
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/pending`: Get pending expenses for approver
  - `/api/v1/expenses/workflow/stats`: Get workflow statistics

### Budget Management
- Budget creation and tracking
- Budget allocation and adjustment
- Budget analysis and reporting

### Reporting Service
- Report generation
- Report scheduling
- Export functionality

## Implementation Approach
1. **Setup Project Infrastructure**:
   - Initialize frontend project with chosen framework
   - Configure routing and state management
   - Set up API service layer

2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Login/signup forms
   - JWT handling
   - Route protection

3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Dashboard components
   - Expense management
   - Approval workflow

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Reporting
   - Analytics
   - Budget management

5. **Polish and Refinement**:
   - UX improvements
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility

## Component Design Guidelines
- Use atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Follow consistent styling using a design system

## State Management
- Use centralized store for application-wide state
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Consider optimistic UI updates for better UX

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Secure token storage (HttpOnly cookies)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control for UI components

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for complex workflows
- End-to-end tests for critical paths
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Set up environment-specific configurations
- Implement feature flags for phased rollout

## Next Steps
1. Create UI mockups and design system
2. Set up project structure and base components
3. Implement authentication flow
4. Develop expense management module
5. Implement approval workflow UI
